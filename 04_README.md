# Project Overhaul

This repository documents the ongoing maturity assessment and overhaul of organizational cybersecurity practices, mapped against key control areas.

## Recent Update

The file [`03_Project_Overhaul_Maturity_Assessment.md`](./03_Project_Overhaul_Maturity_Assessment.md) has been replaced with a comprehensive table covering:

- Asset Management (hardware/software inventories, network diagrams, classification)
- Business Environment (mission, supply chain, resilience planning)
- Governance (security policy, roles, legal/regulatory obligations)
- Risk Assessment (vulnerabilities, threats, business impacts)
- Risk Management Strategy (risk tolerances, stakeholder endorsement)
- Response Planning (incident response, communications, analysis, mitigation, improvement)
- Recovery Planning (disaster recovery, lessons learned, reputation management, communications)

Each section details control objectives, descriptions, guiding questions, pass/fail evaluations, and key comments.

Please refer to the maturity assessment file for specific findings and recommendations.
