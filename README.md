Project Overhaul Oscorp is a comprehensive initiative aimed at transforming Oscorp’s IT and security landscape by assessing current capabilities, identifying maturity gaps, and implementing targeted solutions to enhance operational resilience and cybersecurity. The project began with a detailed analysis of Oscorp’s existing infrastructure, processes, and risk posture, followed by a maturity assessment that benchmarked the organization against industry standards. Key findings highlighted strengths in asset management and network documentation, while revealing areas for improvement in software inventory, periodic reviews, and data flow mapping. Based on these insights, the project developed a tailored solution roadmap focused on closing critical gaps, optimizing resource allocation, and aligning IT practices with business objectives and risk strategy. This README provides an overview of the project’s scope, methodology, and outcomes, serving as a reference for stakeholders and contributors seeking to understand or build upon the work completed.
